Implementation of Principle Component Analysis from scratch for dimensionality reduction of input images, Linear Discriminant Analysis for reducing computation time required for calculation of within-class and inter-class scatter matrix and K Nearest Neighbor classifier is done in Python. The proposed algorithm is tested on three different datasets and gives 100% accuracy on two of them.
